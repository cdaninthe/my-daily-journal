=============
This app was created as part of my portfolio project for Flatiron School, Software Engineer Bootcamp.
The project was required to follow the following:

1- Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format. 

2- Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

3- Use at least 3 unique event-listeners that enable interactivity. Each of your event listeners should have its own unique callback function.

4- Your project must implement at least one instance of array iteration using available array methods (map, forEach, filter, etc). Manipulating your API data in some way should present an opportunity to implement your array iteration.

5- Keep your code DRY by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.
